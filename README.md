# JSON Offsets for Automatic Offsets Updater in Cheat

This project is an adaptation of an automatic offsets updater for cheats, based on a CS:GO codebase. It aims to simplify the process of maintaining and updating offsets in your cheats, ensuring that they are always up-to-date without the need to compile a new loader for your P2C.

## Credits

The original offsets were sourced from the following repository: [Pinguu-dev](https://github.com/Pinguu-dev/)

A special thanks to the contributors of the Pinguu-dev repository for their hard work and dedication to providing up-to-date offsets.
